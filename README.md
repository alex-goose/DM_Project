Project Title: Analysis of Alps Snowdepths Using Data Mining Techniques

Team Memebers: Alexander Gustafson

Description of Project: This project utilizes advanced data mining techniques to analyze and predict snow depth trends in the Alps, focusing on the correlation between elevation and snow accumulation and the impact of climate change on these patterns.

Summary of questions sought and the answers: I investigated how snow depths have changed over the past fifty years, the relationship between snow depth and elevation, and the implications of rising temperatures on snow depths in Alpine ski towns, finding significant decreases in snowfall irrespective of elevation.

Application of this knowledge: The insights from this study are crucial for guiding environmental policies, aiding ski resort operational planning, and informing conservation strategies in alpine regions facing climate variability.
